# Responsive-Portfolio

This was the first part of a two-part homework assignment for the second week of the bootcamp I attended. This portion of the assignment was to rebuild the portfolio mini-site we had built for our first assignment and making it responsive by writing our own media queries. 

You can see this code in action [here](https://ruthieirl.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/index.html).

**For Your Own Curiousity**

The second part of this two-part homework can be found [here](https://github.com/ruthieirl/Bootstrap-Portfolio). In short, we were to rebuild the portfolio mini-site we had built for assignment one using Bootstrap.
